    <h3>BEEEES</h3>
    <p>According to all known laws
        of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.<br>
        Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.<br>


        The bee, of course, flies anyway<br>


        because bees don't care
        what humans think is impossible.<br>


        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>


        Ooh, black and yellow!<br>
        Let's shake it up a little.<br>


        Barry! Breakfast is ready!<br>


        Ooming!<br>


        Hang on a second.<br>


        Hello?<br>


        - Barry?<br>
        - Adam?<br>


        - Oan you believe this is happening?<br>
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.<br>


        Looking sharp.<br>


        Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.<br>


        Sorry. I'm excited.<br>


        Here's the graduate.<br>
        We're very proud of you, son.<br>


        A perfect report card, all B's.<br>


        Very proud.</p>
